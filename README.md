A port of the S-Hull algorithm for Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi Cell generation in 2 dimensions.

The original C++ source by Dr. David Sinclair can be found here: http://www.s-hull.org. The same site includes a link to a C# implementation.

The primary reference for this port was the Java implementation, found here: http://code.google.com/p/jshull/
